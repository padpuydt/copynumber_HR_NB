# Copy number HR NB

Explore copy number data and matching clinical information of 556 high-risk neuroblastoma patients using an R script and the R packages copynumber, biomaRt and survival. More information can be found in the [data descriptor paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018240).

## Available files

copynumber_HR_NB.R: R script to visually explore the copy number data, look up copy number aberrations encompassing your gene of interest, and generate a list of samples to select in the R2 genome browser (see below).
samples_dd.txt: clinical and genomic sample annotations used in the script.
profiles_dd.txt: segmented copy number data

## Alternative ways to analyse data

In addition to this R script, the copy number data can also be analysed using the [R2 web platform](https://hgserver1.amc.nl/cgi-bin/r2/main.cgi?&dscope=NB556HR&option=about_dscope) and a [shiny web application](https://padpuydt.shinyapps.io/check_cn_in_hr_nb/). More information on how to use these tools can be found in the [data descriptor paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018240).
